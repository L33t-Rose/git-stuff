# git-stuff

This is me trying to understand git to the best of my abilities lol.

So here's what I did...

1. Made Remote Repo on Github
2. Made directory in local computer and did the following steps

```
git init

git remote add origin <link to remote repo>

git branch -m main (The default branch name in git is master but on github it's main. You can change the name of the default branch. Check how to below.)

git pull
```

# How to cahnge the default branch name in git

Just run the command below in your terminal :D

```
git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
```

# Pusing changes to your branch

```
git add

git commit -m "Commit Message"

git push origin main(only if your the main branch!)
```
